# Express with ES6

An skeleton express app that allows you to use ES6 syntax. Generated by express-generator cli.

## How to run

Before anything else, you must have node installed on your machine.

### Running Dev Server

Run on your terminal `npm run start:dev`, the server will restart everytime you make a change in your code.

This applciation can run in Docker. If you want to run in Docker and local server individually, I need to run in Docker first, then change PORT in dev.env and run locally. This way, Docker will run in default PORT, and local app will run in new specified port.

### Other scripts

* `transpile` - convert es6 and beyond code to es5 to a folder named `dist-server`
* `clean` - delete transpiled folder
* `build` - clean and transpile

### TODO
Make container image smaller following this tutorial: I'm in Combining Docker and NCC

Seed the Docker DB.
